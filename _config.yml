summary: "I had the chance to develop a wide network and to enhance my personal and technical skills through different positions of supervision and management in companies of various sizes. Today, I am very comfortable to be part of major projects where I can give free rein to my multidisciplinary skills in risk analysis, needs analysis, architecture, design and even in team supervision."
summary_2: "I like to evolve in agile environments with a great awareness of the quality of products developed and continuous improvement initiatives and I really like to integrate these concepts in young companies that only have a limited time and narrow skills. I am looking for innovative backgrounds and offering myself many personal challenges to surpass myself."
summary_3: "You have a project in free software for a non-profit organization ?<br/> Feel free to contact me, it will be a pleasure to help you!"
